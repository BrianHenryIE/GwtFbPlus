    "description": "Dia daoibh agus céad mile fáilte to the first and biggest event of Seachtain na bhFreisir 2016. To start us off with a ‘bang mór’ this year; Trinity Ents along with help from An Cumann Gaelach, SUAS and The Hist have lined up an ‘oíche den chéad scoth’ for all you Freisirí and returners alike.

On the eve of Monday 19th September District 8 will be dubh le daoine, taken over for one massive seisiún that’ll carry on go moch ar maidin. Two massive acts are lined up and ready: Katie Laffan, indie pop queen fresh from a set at ‘An Picnic Leictreac’ will be starting off the night getting us all suas agus ag rince. https://www.facebook.com/katie.laffan/ 

Following her is our main headlining Gaeilgeoir: Daithí. https://www.facebook.com/daithimusic/ The experimental DJ who hit the scene playing in finals of TV shows ‘All Ireland Talent Show’ and Sky’s ‘Must Be The Music’, Daithí is now smashing amach award-winning hits such as ‘Mary Keanes Introduction’ agus ‘Loves on Top’ sure to have the dancefloor filled. After playing a packed tent at ‘Bál na Tríonóide’ last year Daithí is sure to be a crowd-pleaser.

The whole night will be accompanied by TCD’s very own TradSoc getting the céilí going in the smoking area.

Ticéidí will be on sale soon at a price of €10. Ná cailígí amach ar seo, This Party’s Not Cóisir.

They say that paradise is not a place but a state of mind.

Well this Freshers Week Wednesday night Paradise is a very real place.

Get lost among the clouds, follow the crowds and join us in heaven (on earth) for a night of glittering debauchery and dancing. 

Let DU Players and VDP whisk you away, sprinkle you in sparkles and keep the Freshers Ball going long after the clock strikes 12.

Just because you’re in heaven doesn’t mean you have to behave like an angel. Come and dance the night away with all of the other saints and sinners of sesh.

Let your dreams get caught and live your wildest Freshers fantasies on the dance floor of The Academy. 

This will be the Freshers’ Ball of all your dreams.

Disclaimer: There will be excessive amounts of glitter in the air so be prepared to sparkle whether you like it or not.",

    "description": "First time living in the Big Shmoke? Staying in digs, or a house/apartment? Moving up to Dublin and realising you need m8s, or even m9s? Good, because Trinity Ents is here.

We're holding an event so you freshers who are moving out of home for the first time and staying in digs, houses or apartments can meet others in the same (metaphorical) boat!

No Diggity promises cheap drinks, Cheap Thrills, and cheap laughs (No DIG-gity – gettit? \"Digs\"? Ha). We'll have team games for the night with fantastic prizes, and afterwards we'll all be making our way to District 8 a little ways down the road to see Daithí blast out some traditional Irish techno.

We’ll be organising you all into teams for games & challenges, or you can find teammates beforehand (about 3 - 4 other people).

Make sure you join our Facebook group for freshers living in digs, houses or apartments around Dublin to stay in the loop for further events: http://bit.ly/2clAh1l",

Carnivlaw (see what we did there?) will bewitch your mind and ensnare your senses, as you dance the night away in Opium Rooms with antics that are only suitable for the big top. Clear your schedule for one of the biggest nights of Freshers Week on Tuesday, September 20th for the laughably low price of 7 euros.

Dancers? Check
Jugglers? Check
Photo booths? You know it
Popcorn? You're damn right

The only thing missing is candy floss, slushies and face painters.

Oh wait.

We. Have. Them. Too.

So come one, come all, for a night you’ll never remember, with friends you’ll never forget. An event so fun, it should be illegal*. so quit clowning around (#Puns) and put your dancing shoes on.

Carnivlaw. Is. Here.
