They say that paradise is not a place but a state of mind.

Well this Freshers Week Wednesday night Paradise is a very real place.

Get lost among the clouds, follow the crowds and join us in heaven (on earth) for a night of glittering debauchery and dancing.

Let DU Players and VDP whisk you away, sprinkle you in sparkles and keep the Freshers Ball going long after the clock strikes 12.

Just because you’re in heaven doesn’t mean you have to behave like an angel. Come and dance the night away with all of the other saints and sinners of sesh.

Let your dreams get caught and live your wildest Freshers fantasies on the dance floor of The Academy.

This will be the Freshers’ Ball of all your dreams.

Disclaimer: There will be excessive amounts of glitter in the air so be prepared to sparkle whether you like it or not.",

We’ll be having our first rally of the campaign on the 25th February at the Button Factory. Get on down and find out more about our musical policies on disco, funk and 90s house.

We’ll be treating all our faithful supporters to appearances from guest speakers:
Rory “When you get to know him, Enda’s really not that bad” Hughes,
Ross “I was never a member of the RA” McMahon
Dave “Joan Burton? Ah you would” Gray b2b Nick “That money was just resting in my account” Nowlan
Pauric “Session through the recession” Doherty.

Here at BoraBora, we are committed to standing up for the ordinary man, and do so by keeping taxes low and vibes high.

With a portion of proceeds going to 100 Minds, we also hope to do our bit for those who rely on Childline's essential services.

'Let's Dance' for David Bowie

This Thursday, Notorious is shaking it up a little - leaning towards our 90s side, we have created a night in dedication to David Bowie. Preceded by the illustrious Trinity Come Dancing, \"Let's Dance!\" for David Bowie pays homage to the cultural icon that is, was and forever will be David Bowie. We have the heroes of DUDJ's playing the funkiest Bowie and 90's tunes to have you dancing in the streets, or the Button Factory as it may be. With Jack Dunne taking over the decks for the second half of the night, we will be returning to our hip-hop roots but don't fear, we always 90s on the brain. Drinks are cheap, the starman's here and best of all, the proceeds go to the worthy cause of the Trinity Cancer Society.

It's time to brush the stardust off your most funky outfit and go Aladdin-sane in the Button Factory for one night in memory of the Thin White Duke.

Suas Trinity are pleased to announce the arrival of our biggest event of the year (and the biggest event of RAG week 2016) - RAG WEEK RUMBLE!!

You may think charity is all about rainbows, sunshine and unicorns (?) but sometimes all you want to see are some amateur boxers battle it out in the ring for your personal entertainment, right? And you're in luck because we've just so happened to have found willing participants to represent their college societies in the fight to see which society will be crowned champion of RAG week! They've been receiving professional training and preparing for what could be the most glorious night of their lives! (Maybe)

The societies taking part include:
VTP, DU Snowsports, the Phil, the Hist, Law Review, Football Soc, Food & Drink, Hockey Soc, DUPA, Europa, Horse Racing, DUDJ, Trad Soc, TCDSU, SCI-FI, Bio-Soc, Suas, Surfing Soc, Q Soc, S2S and more!

There will be around 15 fights, and then the ring will be taken away to make room for some groovy afters with all the music you love to love!

Early bird tickets for both events will be €15*, ticket sale dates will be announced soon.

**There will be drink deals on the night and many more exciting announcements to come**

To be in with a chance of winning a €25 bar tab for the night comment -  'Let's get Ready to Rumble' and tag a mate!

* All ticket sales and proceeds made on the night will go directly to the RAG week fund.

“Where?”, “When?”, I hear you ask. From 7 to 8.30pm in the Pav on Wednesday the 27th of January. There’ll be a raffle, spot prizes, and of course, new people to be met. And, should you find the whole idea a little daunting, the venue is perfect for… ahem… social lubrication.

Doors: 7pm (come early to get a front seat!)
Admission: €?? (you decide!)

Donations will be taken after the performance, we believe that charity is for everyone regardless of how much you give. Let us delight you and afterwards, you can give your gift to these fine causes in return for our gift to you this Christmas time.

Here's a little more information on the charities we will be supporting :)

ALONE is a charity organization in Ireland highlighting the plight of older people living alone. With more and more people, young and old, coming forward with feelings of loneliness and isolation we felt this was an extremely deserving and important cause to support.

As well we will be supporting The Peter McVerry Trust,  a charity set up by Fr Peter McVerry to reduce homelessness and the harm caused by drug misuse and social disadvantage.
