They say that paradise is not a place but a state of mind.

Well this Freshers Week Wednesday night Paradise is a very real place.

Get lost among the clouds, follow the crowds and join us in heaven (on earth) for a night of glittering debauchery and dancing. 

Let DU Players and VDP whisk you away, sprinkle you in sparkles and keep the Freshers Ball going long after the clock strikes 12.

Just because you’re in heaven doesn’t mean you have to behave like an angel. Come and dance the night away with all of the other saints and sinners of sesh.

Let your dreams get caught and live your wildest Freshers fantasies on the dance floor of The Academy. 

This will be the Freshers’ Ball of all your dreams.

Disclaimer: There will be excessive amounts of glitter in the air so be prepared to sparkle whether you like it or not.",
